# Black Flag White Paper

A primer on copyright and 3D guns.

## Overview

When Zarathustra's three apes founded The Gatalog in June of 2021, they did not yet know they had killed Jstark. Their founding manifesto was a confused but earnest refutation of digital rights management (DRM) written for Ammoland.

On August 25, 2021, they got the first test of these values when Everytown sent a take-down notice to DEFCAD for the removal of three Gatalog files.

Joined by FPC, our groups quickly organized to fight the first federal intellectual property claim in the history of 3D2A.

It would not be the last.
